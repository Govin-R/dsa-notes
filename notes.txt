Learning DSA with python.

Algorithm: 
	- set of steps to solve a problem
	- clear problem statement
	- divide problem into a small steps -> and solve that
	- must produce result
	- take only finite time


Good Algorithm:
	i) Correctness - Algorithm terminates input,prove with maths
	ii) Efficiency - Measured by time,space.
				a) time complexity - how long to take complete task
				b) space complexity - amount of space taken for task

Linear search:
	sequentially search one by one.
